# Testing Info #
Brief overview of how and what I would focus testing on in this project
I would test two main components of this assignment:
    1. Receiving and grabbing correct information from the server
    2. Relative and Absolute Command Arithmetic (Making sure the RGB Values are correct as per the sequence of commands)

Test #1
For this I would make some form of "mock" server that sends a stream of hardcoded commands instead of random.
This way I can assert exactly what should be being stored into the objects in this small application.

Test #2
Once again I would make some form of "mock" that sends a stream of hardcoded commands.
Using this I would be able to run a test on the "commands" array in MainViewController.swift and make sure the order of
RGB Values (the color that is being displayed) stored in the commands are correct based off the sequence of commands
